With Focus Entertainment's takeover of DTG, they have made an exciting announcement for train simulation enthusiasts. Starting from Friday, May 26th, through to June 2nd, all French DLC for Train Sim World and Train Sim Classic will be available for free.

The popular LGV Méditerranée route is now accessible at no cost on all platforms, including Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Additionally, the Marseille - Avignon Route and its extension, Marseille - Avignon, are free for a limited time on Steam. To claim these routes, simply visit the store page and click on "Add to Account."

Moreover, the TGV Voyages pack, featuring the TGV® Réseau and TGV-RDuplex, is also available to enhance your train simulation experience.

It's important to note that this limited-time offer will expire on June 2nd. However, once you add the DLCs to your account during the promotional period, they will remain permanently accessible.

This generous move by Focus Entertainment and DTG presents a wonderful opportunity for players to explore the beauty of French railways and operate iconic French trains. Take advantage of this offer and embark on a captivating journey through the French rail network. Remember to act swiftly and secure these DLCs before the promotional period ends.
