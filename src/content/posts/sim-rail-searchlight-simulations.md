The developers of SimRail recently announced their collaboration with third parties to develop routes and locomotives for the game. Yesterday, SimRail revealed that Searchlight Simulations is currently working on the development of an SD70ACu locomotive and a route centered around Minneapolis, USA. This marks a significant milestone as it is expected to be the first third-party release for SimRail. However, no specific release date has been announced yet.

## Authors Opinion: 

In my personal opinion, the model looks really impressive. The use of the Unity Engine and its graphical capabilities will definitely enhance the overall experience. Although it's evident that the image is still a work in progress, I have great expectations for its final outcome.
