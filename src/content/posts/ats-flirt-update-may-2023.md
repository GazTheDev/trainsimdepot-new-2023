Last week, AlanThomsonSimulation provided us with some exciting details about the highly anticipated Class 755/745 pack on their Facebook group. They shared their progress in development and even treated us to a sneak peek video showcasing the semi-operational cab setup procedure.

First and foremost, Alan emphasized that no release date has been announced yet, and there's still a possibility of changes. However, the level of detail in the cab is truly remarkable, with a strong focus on realism. It's set to be a fantastic addition to the GEML update, which is also being worked on by one of the ATS team as a side project.

According to the post, scripting is progressing well, although there have been some changes in personnel over the past few months due to team members moving on. Nevertheless, they are confident that the final product will maintain the same high quality as before.

Alan also provided insight into the development process, stating that the model is approximately 90% complete. It has been crafted by GU Studios with the assistance of the renowned graphic designer Lewis Clowes.

Here at TrainSimDepot, we couldn't be more thrilled about the upcoming release. We'll keep you updated with any new developments as soon as they are announced. The anticipation is building, and we can't wait to experience the Class 755/745 pack firsthand.

Stay tuned for more news, and get ready for an exciting addition to your train simulation experience!

If you would like to view the full transcript of the post we have detailed it below: 

"This post is to update you all on the current progress of the ATS Class 745/755 Project. First of all, I would like to introduce our new scripter for this project; AND Model - Anadolu Model Demiryolları. AND recently released what I can only describe as one of the most complex simulations of a complete locomotive I have seen in TSC as part of 'Taurus Mountains: Ulukışla – Yenice Route' (Avalible here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2009527/Train_Simulator_Taurus_Mountains_Ulukla__Yenice_Route_AddOn/?curator_clanid=958135&curator_listid=43440 ) Since starting on the FLIRT (745/755) Project AND have shown great skill and passion for the project. With AND being based in Turkey the UK systems and signaling, whilst not new to AND, were different from what they were used to. Working alongside our resident FLIRT specialist and Driving Instructor Hayden, AND have already produced some fantastic results. If you wish to see the level of detail that AND put into their DE24000 locomotive I strongly advise you to check out the manual Here: https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2009527/manuals/ANDModel_-Taurus_Mountains_Route_Manual-_EN.pdf?t=1671529534
So where are we at?
Currently, 98 percent of the modelling is complete as you will have seen from the posts from ourselves and Gü Studios previously. This includes the 745 and 755 and their various subclasses. All of the modeling is up to the excellent standard of Gü Studios with the support of the wonderful Clowes for vectors (TMS and exterior), decals, and of course destinations. Passenger views are also complete from an artwork standpoint and are shown in the video.
Sounds all sounds have been recorded in-house and will be implemented further down the line
Scripting has been started and is progressing well in all areas. The video on show shows the basic start-up sequence and departure with speedset. This doesn't include the full cab mobilisation but a shortened version to show the slightly different driving style of the FLIRTs; in that the PBC is used to apply the amount of traction power applied but the speed is regulated via the speedset. We aim to provide the most true-to-life simulation of the FlIRTs avalible within the restrictions of TSC. The video shown is just a tiny fraction of what's gone into these units already and I hope to be able to bring you more regular updates on the project as it progresses.
Please note we will not be giving any release info until we are ready so there is no need to ask.
My last thing to say is a massive thank you to all of you guys who have shown a keen interest in this project I know it's been slow for various reasons but I am really pleased to have AND on board. I really hope the partnership lasts long beyond just the FLIRTs Thank you guys for your continued support here to the future of TSC. Cheers" - AlanThomsonSim
