To ensure we have the very best content we have a few guidelines we would like to share with you. 

Instead of the normal boring paragraphs about how you shouldn't do X, Y Z. We have bullet pointed below the things we would like to see and not see. 


## Content Guidelines

- All content submitted needs to be checked for SPAG and is written by either yourself or your entity. We don't want content ripped directly from another persons website!. 
- The content submitted needs to have a good level of English and have no bad language. 
- We aim to release a few community pieces a week and just because you have submitted, does not mean it's going on the site straightaway. 
- If you would like to attach image please do. We accept most file types such as .png, .jpg. Although at the moment we are unable to process images through our forms, please either send us a link directly to the image or send it across directly to contact@trainsimdepot.net. We aim to have the form fully working with file attachments soon. 
- To save space on the server, please submit image compressed using TinyPNG, you won't lose quality.
