Train Sim Depot was started in 2021 by Gareth Davies creating YouTube videos with tutorials and other interesting content. Gareth has been toying with the idea to create a news website dedicated to the Rail Simulation hobby and has now fully released the website for all to enjoy. We can't say we will be the first to break news, but we will be the best!.
